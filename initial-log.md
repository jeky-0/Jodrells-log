I am alive.

I know not what happened fully. My memory is fogged, mind fogged.

My vehicle has cease to function. It is powerless.

The only thing I have is a portable transmission computer, of limited range.

There is a peculiar sense of peace.

Location: unknown.

Time: unknown.

Still strapped firmly in.

I appear to be orbiting something. The vessle rotation has not permitted me to see fully.

I am in geo-stationary orbit around a planet. It has sufficient atmosphere.

A planet of blue.
